Here you have the registration of our first talk. Me and with Thibault Ducret presenting</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>:
Decorators and iterators are two built-in features of the Python language, often considered central to being a good <em>Pythonist</em>.</p><p>But why do we need them, and what are their use cases and best practices?</p><p>The idea is to go beyond the classic syntax and examples, to see the true power of these two nuggets ðŸ’Ž of Python.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fLJTOqao_yI style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=big-data-conference-tulouse-tech>Big Data Conference Tulouse Tech<a href=#big-data-conference-tulouse-tech class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>Here you have the registration of a talk that I gave to master students of <strong>UniversitÃ© FÃ©dÃ©rale de Toulouse</strong>.</p><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Machine Learning and Big Data are increasingly an hot topic in the news. But are these algorithms really being used for industrial applications? How can an industry like agriculture use these technologies to improve productivity?
In this talk, I will present the different aspects of data collection and analysis in the context of drones in agriculture (for tree detection for example). We will review examples of problems that have been solved at Alteia by explaining in detail the different steps; from the data acquisition phase to the delivered solution. As needed, key concepts of computer vision and image manipulation will be discussed during the presentation, without any specific prerequisite for their understanding.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AMkrFMPO_E style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><h2 id=toulouse-data-science-meet-up>Toulouse Data Science meet-up<a href=#toulouse-data-science-meet-up class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>A talk that I gave to the Toulouse data science meet-up a while ago, <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/toulousedatascience/datatalk-number-41-deep-learning-on-3d-data-nicola-luminari?slide=2">here you have the link to the slides</a>.</p><img src=/img/tds.jpg alt="Me thinking" class=center style=border-radius:6px><p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Image-based data have forced the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to solve computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation.
However, today, various applications such as drone mapping and automatic driving use different sensors (such as LiDAR) that allow to produce a 3D representation of the scene around the sensor, in form of meshes and point clouds.</p><p>This new kind of data cannot be naively treated with <em>modern</em> CNNs because of various problems related to their 3D nature.
Therefore, new specialized CNNs for 3D data has been proposed in the literature.</p><p>During this talk we will concentrate on point cloud representation of 3D data and we will see why the classical convolution operator cannot be used directly on such data.
Then, we will review the solutions proposed by the deep learning community on this topic.</p><img src=/img/3D_data.png alt="Me thinking" class=center style=border-radius:6px></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
