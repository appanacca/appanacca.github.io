Institut de M√©canique des Fluides in Toulouse. My thesis ‚ÄúModeling and simulation of flows over and through fibrous porous media‚Äù aim to solve the fluid-structure interaction
problem of porous media (like filaments, plumes or riblets) over non-smooth walls. Such surfaces exhist in nature for example in the shark and owls skin.
Such surfaces are interesting because, in some speed regimes, they have better aerodynamic performances.
My main focus was to implement the computational fluid dynamics simulations to test our hypotesis.
During the PhD I had the opportunity to write a lot of code, (C++ and Python) and play with machines with hundreds of CPUs.</p><h1 id=summer-of-hpc>Summer of HPC<a href=#summer-of-hpc class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h1><img src=/img/hpc.png alt="Me thinking" class=center style=border-radius:6px><p>When I was still an undergraduate I had the opportunity to partecipate in the <a href=https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/project-reports-2014-nicola/>Summer of High Performance Computing</a>, in which me and <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinwe/>Martin Weber</a> develop a car race game. Inside the project I was in charge of the physic engine, for which I had implemented the aerodynamic simulation of a race car.
Each simulation runned on a 10.000 cores machine and was powered by the OpenFOAM framework (that is writtent in C++). I have also won the
