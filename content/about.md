I am the Head of Data Science departement at Alteia (formerly part of the Delair software team). My team focus around various computer vision problems with drone sensor data.
Inside a very skilled and interdisciplinary team I have helped to develop many deep learning task such as:
* semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds
* image classification using highly imbalanced datasets
* 3D reconstrcution of industrial assets using neural radiance fields
* detection of critical infrastructures using Santinel 1 and 2 multispectral and SAR data

These tasks are now used in pruduction by majour companies in agricolture and electrical infrastructures sector.

I was proud to be one of the advisors of [Gaston Lenczner](https://gaslen.github.io/) in his PhD in [__Interactive semantic segmentation of aerial images with
deep neural networks__](https://theses.hal.science/tel-03814978/document) .

I was a PhD student under [Prof. Alessandro Bottaro](http://www3.dicca.unige.it/bottaro/) and [Prof. Christophe Airiau](https://www.imft.fr/?lang=en) at the 
Institut de M√©canique des Fluides in Toulouse. My thesis ‚ÄúModeling and simulation of flows over and through fibrous porous media‚Äù aim to solve the fluid-structure 	interaction
problem of porous 	media (like filaments, plumes or 	riblets)  over non-smooth walls. Such surfaces exhist in nature for example in the shark and owls skin. 
Such surfaces are interesting because, in some speed regimes, they have better aerodynamic performances. 
My main focus was to implement the computational fluid dynamics simulations to test our hypotesis. 
During the PhD I had the opportunity to write a lot of code, (C++ and Python) and play with machines with hundreds of CPUs.

When I was still an undergraduate I had the opportunity to partecipate in the [Summer of High Performance Computing](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/project-reports-2014-nicola/), in which me and [Martin Weber](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinwe/) develop a car race game. Inside the project I was in charge of the physic engine, for which I had implemented the aerodynamic simulation of a race car. 
Each simulation runned on a 10.000 cores machine and was powered by the OpenFOAM framework (that is writtent in C++). I have also won the 
      [best student prize üèÜ](https://summerofhpc.prace-ri.eu/sohpc14-best-student-prize-winner-nicola-luminari/)
