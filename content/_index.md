# Hi there 👋
My name is Nicola Luminari I am an engineer 🤖 with a PhD in Fluid Mechanics 🌊 that has fallen in love with programming 💾 along the way. At the moment I am in a relationship with neural networks 🧠.
This is a space where I post interesting stuff that I came about (rarely, but I hope to be more consistent).

I hope you enjoy it! Please connect with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Appanacca) 🐦.
